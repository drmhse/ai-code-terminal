<!-- 
This file has been refactored to use external CSS files for better isolation:
- /static/css/shared.css - Common variables and base styles  
- /static/css/main.css - Main site styles (isolated with .main-site)
- /static/css/docs.css - Documentation styles (isolated with .docs-site)

The conditional loading is handled in head.html based on the page section.
Original styles moved to respective files for maintainability and GitBook-style docs layout.
