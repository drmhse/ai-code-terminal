# Security Overview

AI Code Terminal implements comprehensive security measures throughout the system. As a self-hosted solution, these features protect your code, credentials, and development environment under your direct control.

## Data Encryption

**Sensitive Information Protection**
Your installation encrypts all sensitive data using industry-standard methods:
- **AES-256-CBC encryption** for GitHub OAuth tokens in the database
- **Installation-specific encryption keys** - Each deployment uses unique keys
- **Secure key management** - Encryption keys stored separately from encrypted data
- **Database protection** - Even with database access, credentials remain encrypted

**Secure Communication Channels**
All network communications are encrypted:
- **HTTPS/TLS encryption** for all web interface traffic
- **Encrypted WebSocket connections** for real-time terminal sessions
- **Secure API connections** to GitHub and external services
- **No plaintext transmission** of sensitive information

## Environment Isolation

**Container-Based Isolation**
Your development environment runs in secure Docker containers:
- **Complete process isolation** from the host operating system
- **Filesystem boundaries** preventing access outside designated areas
- **Resource limits** preventing runaway processes from affecting system performance
- **Network isolation** with controlled external access
- **Security containment** - Issues remain isolated within containers

**Workspace Security Boundaries**
File operations are strictly controlled:
- **Directory confinement** - Operations limited to workspace directories
- **Path validation** - All file paths verified before operations
- **Safe file handling** - Restricted access to system and configuration files
- **Controlled permissions** - Appropriate file and directory permissions enforced

## Input Security

**Comprehensive Input Validation**
All user input is validated and sanitized:
- **Path traversal prevention** - File paths validated to prevent directory traversal
- **Terminal input sanitization** - Commands and input properly sanitized
- **Repository URL validation** - Git URLs verified before cloning operations
- **Data type validation** - All input verified against expected formats

**Safe File Operations**
File handling includes multiple security layers:
- **File type restrictions** - Operations limited to safe file types
- **Size limitations** - Prevents excessive resource consumption
- **Location restrictions** - File operations confined to authorized directories
- **Content scanning** - Basic validation of file contents

## Authentication and Access Control

**Single-Tenant Security Model**
Designed for individual use with simplified security:
- **One authorized user** - Only your configured GitHub username can access
- **No multi-user complexity** - Eliminates user separation vulnerabilities
- **Direct control** - You manage access through GitHub OAuth configuration
- **Session isolation** - Each session is completely isolated

**Secure Session Management**
Login sessions use industry-standard security practices:
- **JWT token authentication** with configurable expiration times
- **Automatic session invalidation** when logging out
- **Failed login monitoring** - Protection against brute force attempts  
- **Web vulnerability protection** - Guards against common session attacks

**GitHub OAuth Integration**
Authentication leverages GitHub's secure infrastructure:
- **No password storage** - System never handles or stores passwords
- **Encrypted token storage** - OAuth tokens encrypted in local database
- **Automatic token refresh** - Seamless token renewal without re-authentication
- **Revocable access** - Remove access anytime from GitHub settings

## Network Security

**Defense-in-Depth Network Protection**
Multiple layers protect against network-based attacks:
- **CORS policy enforcement** - Prevents unauthorized cross-origin requests
- **Security headers** - Protection against common web vulnerabilities
- **Rate limiting** - Prevents API abuse and DoS attacks
- **Minimal service exposure** - Only necessary ports and services accessible

**Controlled External Communication**
External connections are limited and secured:
- **GitHub API only** - Limited external communication to GitHub services
- **Claude API** - Only when you initiate AI assistance
- **HTTPS enforcement** - All external communications encrypted
- **No analytics or tracking** - No data sent to external monitoring services

## Container Security

**Secure Runtime Environment**
Docker containers implement security best practices:
- **Non-root execution** - Application runs as unprivileged user
- **Read-only filesystem** - System files protected from modification
- **Minimal base image** - Reduced attack surface through minimal software
- **Resource constraints** - Memory and CPU limits prevent resource exhaustion

**Security-Hardened Configuration**
Container configuration emphasizes security:
- **Capability restrictions** - Limited container capabilities
- **Network restrictions** - Controlled network access
- **Volume security** - Secure mounting of data volumes
- **Process isolation** - Separate process namespaces

## Maintenance and Updates

**Security Update Management**
Keep your installation secure through regular updates:
- **Dependency monitoring** - Regular scanning for vulnerable dependencies
- **Security patches** - Timely updates for security vulnerabilities
- **Configuration updates** - Security policy and setting improvements
- **Documentation updates** - Current security guidance and best practices

**Vulnerability Management**
Proactive security maintenance:
- **Regular security audits** - Ongoing code and dependency review
- **Community oversight** - Open source enables security research and review
- **Responsible disclosure** - Clear process for reporting security issues
- **Rapid response** - Quick fixes for critical security issues

## Privacy Protection

**Data Minimization Practices**
Your installation collects only necessary information:
- **Essential data only** - No unnecessary data collection or storage
- **No tracking** - No analytics, metrics, or user behavior tracking
- **Temporary session data** - Terminal sessions not permanently stored
- **Limited external data** - Minimal information shared with external services

**Local Data Control**
Complete control over your information:
- **Local storage only** - All data remains within your installation
- **User-controlled retention** - You set data retention and cleanup policies
- **Direct data access** - Full access to all stored information
- **Immediate deletion** - Remove any data at any time

## Transparency and Auditability

**Open Source Security**
Complete visibility into security implementation:
- **Full source code access** - Audit all security measures and implementations
- **No hidden functionality** - All security features are documented and visible
- **Community review** - Open source enables security research and improvement
- **Verifiable security** - You can verify that documented security features exist

**No Security Through Obscurity**
Security relies on strong implementation, not secrecy:
- **Public security model** - All security measures work even when visible
- **Documented approaches** - Security methods fully documented
- **Testable security** - Security measures can be independently verified
- **Transparent vulnerabilities** - Open discussion of security issues and fixes

## Your Security Responsibilities

**Best Security Practices**
Maximize security through good practices:
- **Keep installations updated** - Regular updates include security improvements
- **Strong GitHub authentication** - Use strong passwords and two-factor authentication
- **Secure API key management** - Protect your Claude API keys appropriately
- **Regular access reviews** - Periodically review GitHub OAuth applications
- **Secure hosting environment** - Ensure your hosting infrastructure is secure

**Incident Response**
Respond appropriately to security concerns:
- **GitHub credential security** - Change passwords if you suspect compromise
- **OAuth application management** - Revoke and recreate OAuth applications if needed
- **System updates** - Update to latest versions immediately for security issues
- **Issue reporting** - Report security vulnerabilities to project maintainers

This comprehensive security approach ensures your self-hosted development environment maintains the highest security standards while remaining under your complete control.
