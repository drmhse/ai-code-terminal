# File Explorer

The built-in file explorer provides a familiar sidebar interface for navigating your codebase, previewing files, and performing common file operations—all without leaving your terminal environment.

## Features

**Sidebar File Browser**
Navigate your repository structure using the familiar tree-view sidebar. Expand and collapse directories, and see your entire project structure at a glance.

**File Preview**
Click any file to preview its contents directly in the interface. Support for:
- **Code files:** Syntax highlighting for popular languages (JavaScript, Python, Go, etc.)
- **Markdown files:** Rendered preview with proper formatting
- **JSON/YAML:** Formatted and syntax-highlighted configuration files
- **Text files:** Plain text with line numbers
- **Images:** Inline image preview for common formats

**Context Menus**
Right-click files and directories for quick actions:
- Create new files and folders
- Rename existing files
- Delete files and directories
- Copy file paths to clipboard

**Search and Navigation**
Find files quickly with built-in search functionality. Filter by file name or type to locate exactly what you need.

## Why Use the File Explorer

**Seamless Workflow**
Keep your focus on coding. Browse files in the sidebar while keeping your terminal active in the main panel. No need to switch between applications or open separate file managers.

**Quick File Operations**
Common file tasks are just a right-click away. Create new components, rename files, or clean up directories without typing terminal commands.

**Code Context**
Preview files to understand your codebase structure before opening them in your terminal editor. See imports, dependencies, and file relationships at a glance.

**Repository Overview**
Get a bird's-eye view of your project structure. Understand how files are organized and quickly locate specific components or configuration files.

## Getting Started

1. **File Tree Navigation:** Click the folder icon in the sidebar to open the file explorer
2. **Expand Directories:** Click the arrow next to folders to explore their contents
3. **Preview Files:** Click any file name to preview its contents in the main area
4. **Right-Click Actions:** Right-click files or folders to access the context menu
5. **Search Files:** Use the search box at the top to find specific files

## Common Workflows

**Exploring New Projects**
When you first clone a repository, use the file explorer to:
- Understand the project structure
- Locate configuration files (package.json, Dockerfile, etc.)
- Find the main application entry points
- Preview README and documentation files

**Development Tasks**
During development, use the explorer to:
- Create new component files
- Navigate to test files
- Preview configuration changes
- Organize project assets

**Code Review**
When reviewing changes:
- Browse modified files
- Preview file contents before opening in editor
- Compare file structures across branches
- Navigate related files quickly

## Pro Tips

**Keyboard Navigation**
Use standard navigation keys to move through the file tree efficiently. Arrow keys expand/collapse folders and move between items.

**File Type Recognition**
The explorer automatically recognizes file types and provides appropriate icons and previews. This makes it easy to distinguish between code, configuration, and asset files.

**Path Copying**
Right-click any file and select "Copy Path" to get the full file path in your clipboard—perfect for terminal commands or import statements.

**Integration with Terminal**
The file explorer works alongside your terminal sessions. Preview a file in the explorer, then quickly open it in your terminal editor with the full path ready to use.
