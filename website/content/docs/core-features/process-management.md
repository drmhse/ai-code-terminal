# Process Management

AI Code Terminal includes a process supervisor that can track and manage long-running processes within your terminal sessions, providing persistence and monitoring capabilities for development workflows.

## How It Works

**Process Tracking**
The system can track processes that you explicitly register for supervision:
- Long-running development servers
- Build tools and watchers
- Database servers and services
- Custom background processes

**Background Supervision**
Once tracked, processes are monitored and maintained:
- Process health monitoring every 10 seconds
- Automatic cleanup of terminated processes
- Optional automatic restart on process failure
- Process persistence across application restarts

**Session Integration**
Supervised processes integrate with your terminal sessions:
- Associated with specific workspaces and sessions
- Status reporting and management through API
- Integration with terminal multiplexing system

## Why This Matters

**Process Persistence**
Tracked processes can survive terminal disconnections and browser refreshes, maintaining long-running development workflows without interruption.

**Resource Monitoring**
Keep track of process resource usage and health, with automatic cleanup of failed or terminated processes.

**Development Workflow Integration**
Integrate process supervision with your workspace and terminal session management for organized development environments.

## Process Management Features

**Process Lifecycle Management**
- Explicit process tracking through API endpoints
- Process health monitoring and status reporting
- Controlled process termination and cleanup
- Optional automatic restart on failure

**Integration Capabilities**
- Workspace-specific process tracking
- Session-based process association
- API-based process management interface
- Integration with terminal multiplexing system

**Monitoring and Maintenance**
- Regular health checks of tracked processes
- Automatic cleanup of dead processes
- Process metadata and status tracking
- Resource usage monitoring

## Process Management API

**View Tracked Processes**
Access information about supervised processes through API endpoints:
- Current status and process metadata
- Runtime duration and resource information
- Process association with workspaces and sessions
- Health status and monitoring data

**Process Control Operations**
Manage tracked processes through available API actions:
- **Start Tracking:** Register a process for supervision
- **Stop Process:** Terminate a tracked process
- **Restart Process:** Stop and restart a supervised process
- **Remove Tracking:** Stop supervising a process

**Status and Monitoring**
Access detailed information about process health and status:
- Process lifecycle events and state changes
- Resource usage and performance metrics
- Integration with workspace and session management
- Health check results and monitoring data

## Usage Guidelines

**Explicit Process Tracking**
Processes must be explicitly registered for supervision through the API. The system does not automatically detect or track terminal processes.

**Resource Considerations**
Consider the resource impact of process supervision:
- Monitor system resources when tracking multiple processes
- Use supervision for long-running processes that benefit from persistence
- Clean up completed or no longer needed tracked processes

**Integration with Workspaces**
Process supervision integrates with workspace management:
- Associate processes with specific workspaces
- Organize process tracking by development environment
- Coordinate process lifecycle with workspace operations

## Implementation Details

**Process Supervision Architecture**
The process supervisor service provides:
- Background monitoring of tracked processes (10-second intervals)
- Database persistence of process metadata and status
- Integration with workspace and session management systems
- API endpoints for process control and status reporting

**Health Monitoring**
Tracked processes are monitored for:
- Process lifecycle events (start, stop, crash)
- Resource usage and system impact
- Integration with terminal session management
- Cleanup of terminated or orphaned processes

This process management system provides a foundation for supervising long-running development processes while maintaining integration with the broader terminal and workspace management features of AI Code Terminal.
