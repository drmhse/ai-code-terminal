## Theme Features

**Syntax Highlighting**

## Why Themes Matter

**Reduce Eye Strain**
The right theme can significantly reduce eye fatigue during long coding sessions. Dark themes are easier on your eyes in low-light conditions, while light themes work better in bright environments.

**Improve Focus**
A theme you enjoy makes coding more pleasant. When your environment looks good, you're more likely to stay focused and productive.

**Personal Expression**
Your development environment should reflect your style. Choose themes that make you feel comfortable and inspired while you code.

**Accessibility**
High-contrast themes help developers with visual impairments or those who prefer maximum readability.

## Pro Tips

**Match Your Environment**
- Use dark themes in dimly lit rooms
- Switch to light themes in bright, well-lit spaces
- Try high-contrast themes if you have vision difficulties

**Time-Based Switching**
Many developers prefer dark themes for evening/night work and light themes during the day. Switch as needed for optimal comfort.

**Syntax Highlighting**
Pay attention to how different themes handle syntax highlighting. Some themes make it easier to distinguish between different code elements.

**Consistency Across Tools**
Consider choosing a theme that matches your other development tools (IDE, text editor, etc.) for a consistent visual experience.
